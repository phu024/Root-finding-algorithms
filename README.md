# Root-finding Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various root-finding algorithms in different programming languages.

## What are root-finding algorithms?

Root-finding algorithms are numerical methods used to find roots (or zeroes) of a given function. A root of a function f(x) is a value of x for which f(x) = 0. Root-finding algorithms are used in various fields of science and engineering to solve problems that cannot be solved analytically.

## Implemented Algorithms

The following root-finding algorithms have been implemented in this repository:

- Bisection Method
- Newton-Raphson Method
- Secant Method
- Regula-Falsi Method
<!-- - Brent's Method -->

## Languages Used

The algorithms have been implemented in the following programming languages:

- Python
<!-- - C++
- Java
- MATLAB
- JavaScript
- Julia -->

## How to Use

Each algorithm is implemented in its own file in each programming language. To use a particular algorithm in a specific programming language, simply run the corresponding file.

For example, to use the Bisection Method implemented in Python, run the `bisection_method.py` file using the command:

```
python bisection_method.py
```

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you would like to add an implementation of a root-finding algorithm in a language that is not yet supported, feel free to create a pull request.
